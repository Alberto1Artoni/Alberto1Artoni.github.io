I am a  Mathematical Engineering, graduated at Politecnico di Milano: I studied Computational Science.

My mainly interests are Finite Element Methods (FEM), fluids (CFD) and Machine Learning (ML).

Here is a brief version my [curriculum](https://alberto1artoni.github.io/assets/pdf/Curriculum.pdf).

I've decided to collect in this pages all the projects I haveve followed and all my interests.


## College 
I've live in Collegio Paolo VI for 6th year.
I am involved in activities and I led some speaks:
[Sidamo](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Alberto1Artoni/Alberto1Artoni.github.io/blob/master/SidamoTalk.pdf)
[Cv](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Alberto1Artoni/Alberto1Artoni.github.io/blob/master/Cv_Presentazione.pdf)
First speak was about the importance of volunteering as a path to meet the other, and the second was about curriculum writing.

I think the College experience has had a great impact of my life: being in contact with very different people and with different needs made me grow.


## My free time

And this is what I do on my free time... I lead a group of 6 educators teaching to 50 kids!

Following are in italian:

- [Presentatation of the activities of 2018/2019](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Alberto1Artoni/Alberto1Artoni.github.io/blob/master/Beamer_Presentazione_CateCoro%281%29.pdf)
