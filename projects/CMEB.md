### Computational

The course is about

## Coupling a PDE Problems with the Kinetic Monte-Carlo

I've interfaced in the FEMOS 3D library both a Poisson and a thermal coupling with the Kinetic MonteCarlo approach.

Qui metto l'immagine in tikz di che succede

Finally, several configurations have been explored.

## Results

The imposed electric field (computed with the Poisson equation) moves the particles. The temperature (computed via heat equation) makes the particle vibrate.

## Further developments

The project is a first step in more detailed investigation about the coupling between the particle world and the PDE world. This is one of the first attemps. From a practical point of view, devices like RRAM can be designed.
