## Paolo VI

*Nel collegio* [Paolo VI](http://www.collegiopaolosesto.it/)  *i giovani sono incoraggiati e sostenuti nel loro impegno quotidiano di studio in vista del raggiungimento degli obiettivi accademici e nello stesso tempo sono chiamati a formarsi come persone, vivendo insieme in vicendevole stima e fiducia, coltivando relazioni e amicizie destinate a durare nel tempo e confrontandosi con la proposta cristiana.*


### College

In the college I found a lot of friends and careful educators. I think I can say that I've never felt alone or lost: in trouble moments both the college students and both the educators were there to cheer me up.
I've been in the college for six years: It's interesting how to see the changements in the place where you live. Educators change, students go away; even the college itself has been renovated. 


### Sport 

I've been the goalkeeper of the football team from 2016 to 2019. We partecipated (without much success, but with a lot of fun) to Torneo Intercollegiale.

I broke my cruciate ligament on 16/04/2019, and since then I've stopped playing.

### Talks
I found myself as a senior member of the college community, and I've decided to start teaching something to the other students.
Here are a talk and a lab I've led:

-I've been a volunteer for [Sidamo](https://alberto1artoni.github.io/assets/pdf/SidamoTalk.pdf): here I detailed my experience and the importance of volunteering.

-I've decided to share my experience in [Cv and Cl writing](https://alberto1artoni.github.io/assets/pdf/Cv_Presentazione.pdf), introducing Latex as a possible editor instrument.
